// what not to do!
/*

Javascript's "with" statement is unreliable and expensive
with keyword takes the entire encapsulated environment of the parameter
object and use it to build a new, "local" to the block scope.
you cannot buiild anon functions or properties on the fly and have them
leave that scope without using dot notation.
Best practice: use variables to cache objects shorthand for ease of editing

Eval may not be evil but it affects legibility, ability to debug, and performance.
